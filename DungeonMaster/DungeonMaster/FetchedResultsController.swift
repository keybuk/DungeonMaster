// TODO index path API

// TODO other API methods I'm missing?
// - check API for compatibility, e.g. I think section should have .objects?
// - don't stick just because, think about each case
// - likewise maybe get rid of ? where it makes no sense, e.g. pre-performFetch()

// TODO it might be cheaper to just build+update sectionIndexes rather than cache-as-we-go

// TODO static sections
// - optional array of [Section] passed at constructor time, stored in a variable
// - variable can be changed/re-evaluated at performFetch() time
// - sections in this set do not get purged when empty

// TODO placeholder entry in sections
// - need to check where I use this, e.g all sections, or certain ones
// - object would still have to conform to Entity, which is not able to be an optional

// TODO it would be nice for sections to be able to be managed objects in their own right
// - would need to wrap somewhere to turn Section into ObjectIdentifier(Section) everywhere
// - would need to sort Section objects by NSSortDescriptor instead of directly comparable
// - using nil in a sort descriptor means self, so we could do this without a block

/// Provides a dynamic results set for a Core Data fetch request.
///
/// The results are determined by the `NSFetchRequest` and `NSManagedObjectContext` provided during initialization, and are made available in `fetchedObjects` once `performFetch()` has been called. Changes to `managedObjectContext` are observed, and `fetchedObjects` is updated automatically based on the changes.
///
/// Objects are sorted into sections based on the `sectionForObject` block provided during initialization, and are made available in the `sections`, with sections identified by a value of your choosing providing the type confirms to `Hashable` and `Comparable`. For efficiency, you can avoid repeated calls to `sectionForObject` unless specific keys of the object change by providing those keys in the optional `sectionKeys` initializer parameter.
///
/// Unlike `NSFetchedResultsController`, changes are always observed. To receive notification provide a block to the `handleChanges` initializer parameter. This block is passed an array of `FetchedResultsChange`, index paths (including those for updates) always refer to the index path prior to the changes being applied while the new index paths always refer to the index path after all changes have been applied.
///
/// # Changes to the controller
/// Various changes to the controller are permitted: changes to the `fetchRequest` `predicate` and `sortDescriptors`, and sectioning criteria by changing the `sectionForObject` block and corresponding `sectionKeys`.
///
/// After making changes you must call `performFetch()` to refresh both `fetchedObjects` and `sections`.
///
/// When called without parameters, you should reload the data of your `view` to match the new results, e.g. through `UITableView.reloadData()`:
///
///     controller.fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = ...
///     try! controller.performFetch()
///     tableView.reloadData()
///
/// In some circumstances, particularly if the changes are a result of transitioning between editing and non-editing states, you may instead wish to update the view through the normal `handleChanges` block. Drop the call to reload the data and instead call `performFetch(notifyChanges: true)`.
