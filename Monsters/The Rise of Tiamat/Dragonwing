Once per turn, if the dragonwing makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.

Limited Flight.
The dragonwing can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

Pack Tactics.
The dragonwing has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonwing's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

ACTIONS

Scimitar.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) damage of the type to which the cultist has damage resistance.
