LEGENDARY ACTIONS

If she is wearing the /Black Dragon Mask/, Rezmir can take up to two legendary actions between each of her turns, taking the actions all at once or spreading them over the round.

If any of the area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
